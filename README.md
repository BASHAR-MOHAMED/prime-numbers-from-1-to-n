# 🔢 Prime Numbers from 1 to N – C++ Program

This is a simple C++ console program that prints all prime numbers from 1 up to a user-specified number N.

---

## 📌 Features

- Input validation to ensure positive numbers only
- Uses functions for modular, clean code
- Checks primality efficiently
- Clear and user-friendly output

---

## 💻 How It Works

1. User is prompted to enter a positive number N
2. The program loops from 2 to N and checks each number using a checkPrime() function
3. If a number is prime, it is printed to the screen

---

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

 ```bash
g++ prime_numbers.cpp -o primes
./primes

📋 Example Output
Please enter a positive number:
20
Prime numbers from 1 to 20:

3
5
7
11
